memoization is an optimization technique that makes applications more efficient and hence faster. It does this by storing computation results in cache, and retrieving that same information from the cache the next time it's needed instead of computing it again.


Condition: op that leads to bool output
Rule: collection of conditions
Engine: collection of rules leading to an over evaluation result

Why Warnermedia implementation
    Limit complexity and nesting (flat representation)
    json persistence (export) of Engine for visualization (ex: jsongrid)
        always flat

decouple application from rule set
    persist in DB and use in another service
    evolve rules separately from service code
    get engine instance (rule set from s3)
