Building a data mesh with open source technologies

Data engineer who needs a platform to experiment
needs to find data/ trusted data fast
go to prod quickly

Data storage
    warehouse via ELT/ETL pipeline
        well organized
        schema changes are expensive
        new sources of data are complex to add
    data lake
        easy to store
        schema designed on read
        burden is on reader of data
        eventually turns into swamp
    
    ingest -> bronze/raw -> silver/pure -> gold/ rich data
        cache to data lake

    where is governance, where is lineage, where is SME  

Key problems
    data quality
    data freshness latency
    ownership
    metrics and measures
    source of truth
    migration to cloud

    cataloging
        columns
        description
        types
        no opensource solutions

    governance 
        size of company is irrelevant
        no open source
    shapes
        structured vs unstructured
        streaming

    Roles to serve
        in
            data architenct 
            data product owner 
            chief data officer

        out
            science
            analytics

big data pipeline  
    hybrid datastores
        why one only
        customer needs
        combining search services
    

compute vs storage
    on prem - limited
    cloud: split and grow at difference pace

data platform   
    foundation bricks
        digital business technologies
        connect and accelerate

Data mesh 
    solve key problems

    principles
        domain ownership
            align business tech and analytics around domain
            scale by teams
            closer to business
        data as product
            discoverable
            addressable
            understandable
            trustworthy and truthful
            interoperable and composable
            native access
            valuable to own
            secure
            data application life cycle
        self-service data platform
            remove friction
            reduce time to market
            keep governance
        federated computational governance
            "power to the people"
            data governance transfered to domain level
            create a federation of data governing bodies vs. central organization
                enterpise creates vision, domain implements it 
            not just about data - about compute, too  

Data mesh
    new shape: data with antennas
        control clients
        discovery
            dictionary, etc
        sources
            ingest and federate
            analytics and operational data clients
        consumers
THE DATA QUANTUM  (as building blocks)
    control services
    source services
    dictionary services 

    data onboarding
        observe, quality, tranformation
    interoperable data 


Meshing data    
    each data quantum focuses on domain
    sources -> product a + b => data product c => applications (1..n)

    microservices meet data 
        apis are the same fro contorl observatiblity and discovery

    data contracts 
        binding but flexible
        contracts are exchanged between quanta 
            think inheritance in OOO 

    high reusability
        just add a new contracts
    quantum dictionary
        gather all contracts and quanta and put in elasticsearch
    

    IMPLEMENTATION
        three planes
            data mesh 
                management tools, dictionary, relationships between quanta 
            data product 
                single quantum
            infrastructure
                databases and sources
    quantum has integral data - storage into ex: mysql 
    great expectations --> for quality?

    consumers 
        jupyter, extensions for notebooks for observatiblity, discovery and control 

    user 
        trusted data
        dictionary
        in notebook

    DE builds quanta instead of pipelines


    takeaways
        data servers users
        four principles
        data contract defineses gehavior of data processoor
        data product implemented as quantum
