Keeping and eye on your cloud native applications with opentelemetry

why is something happening
    performance bottlenecks
    points of failure
    unexpected behaving

observation techniques
    metrics collection adn observabilty
    lots of languages
    lots of trace/metrics formats
    lots of viz and analysis tools


    jaegoer, zipkin, prometheurs, instana, aws xray
        might need to change if solution doesn't satisfy need .... hard to change

opentelemetry
    distrbited tracing 
    metrics
    log collection
    supports client instrumentation

    dropin for frameworks like .net 
    CNCF project - from opentracing and opencensus

    Features
        open source
        standardized approch
        multiple data formats
        export to multiple backend formats 
            multiple tools supported
        no vender lockin because easy to switch output formats

            format = protobuf
            output = binary, json
            transport =http or grpc

        agent to -> oltp -> backend
        serverless -> oltp -> backend

        opentelemetry collector
            aggregate from different output formats
            send to multiple backends
            and can fanout

receiever
    gets data into a collector 
    push or pull 
    signals (traces metrics, logs, "baggage")
    multiple out of the box 
        docker k8, etc 
        postgres, rabbit...snowflake?>https://github.com/HGInsights/opentelemetry_snowpack

processor 
    buffer, batch
    memory limiter - prefvent out of memory on collector (drop data or GC)
    contrib/tree/main/processor

exporter
    reformat from interal format to backend format
        jaeger zipkin prometheus instana, AWS services etc, 

instrumentation
    most frameworks... .net, java, etc 
    auto instrumentation when possible, but some might fall short, like Go 
    traces, metrics, logs
